function setHLM(inferenceMode,synthMode,aggregationMode,whichJAGS,whichQuals,doParallel,startDir,version)

% setHLM sets up multiple HLM models to run sequentially according to inputs

% This function takes the following inputs:

% inferenceMode - set whether to do patameter estimation (1) or model selection (2)
% synthMode     - sets how to simulate data ; (1) Real data
%                                             (2) Simulated data
% whichJAGS     - which copy of matjags to run on. this allows parallel jobs to run as long as they use different matjags
% whichQuals    - sets the order of qualities to run
% doParallel    - whether to run chains in parallel
% version       - which version of experimental setup to run on;(1) One gamble version
%                                                               (2) Two gamble version
%                                                               (3) Two gamble version w. wealth controls
%                                                               (4) Two gamble version w. different additive c
%                                                               (5) Two gamble version w. hidden wealth
