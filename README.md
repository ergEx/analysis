_Note: currently requires python=3.9_

# Code repository for all analysis associated with the ErgEx experiment

This repository contains all code (Python v3.9, Matlab R2021b, JAGS v4.03, R v4.3.1) used to produce data analysis and figures for the ergodicity experiment. Fundamentally the code estimates risk-preferences under isoelastic utility for agents/participants playing the ergEx game see details on experiment here: https://github.com/ergEx/experiment.

# Prerequisites

This code currently requires python=3.9 to run. A requirements.txt file is provided containing all other required modules. To do the analysis in R, we advise using conda and to create a new environment using the environment.yml file.
This will create an environment including both R and Python in the required versions.
Note: running the Bayes Factor Design Analysis will require installing the package from GitHub, so it is done inside the script.

Install and check if environment already exists:
`conda env create -f environment.yml || conda env update -f environment.yml`.

# Analysis


## Bayes Factor Design Analysis
To run the Bayes Factor Design Analysis after installing the environment use in the main folder:
`rscript r_analyses/ergEx_rr_nhb_bfda.R`. When run the first time the BFDA package will be installed.
The figures referred to in the paper will be created inside the `r_analyses` folder.

## Step 0: Create supporting plots for paper

These do not need any data, and can be created by running `python step0_create_supporting_plots.py` from inside the
`ergex` conda environment. Figures will be saved under `figs\support`.

## Step 1 Accessing data

We already provide you with the data format that we use for our analysis (`all_data.csv` and `all_data.mat`) on OSF __HERE URL__.

So it should not be necessary to rerun the following.

`python step1_read_data config_files/config_1_pilot.yaml`

In this step the data is collected from the location specified in
`configs[input_path]`. If it is not specified `configs[data_directory]` is used.
The data will be saved in `configs[data_directory]`, which is relative to the
`data\` directory of the repository.

To download the CPH data, execute `\data\CPH\reading_cph_data.py`, inside the `\data\CPH` folder.

We also provide the simulation data in the `all_data.csv` format. However, to re-do the simulations you will need to
execute the `simulate_agents.py` script in the experiment repository (https://github.com/ergEx/experiment).

## Step 2: Run jags

This step requires to be run with Matlab and matjags. Again, we provide you with the output data, so you can conduct the
main analysis, without re-running the JAGS analysis.

The second stage of the pipeline uses the 'all_data.mat' file and estimates the parameters via JAGS software (detailed information on JAGS installation can be found _HERE_).
The results of the Bayesian model are saved either as 'JAGS_parameter_estimation_{pooling}.mat', or as 'JAGS_model_model_selection_{MODELS}.mat' files.

For each dataset (pilot, full, CPH, or the simulations) step 2 needs to be called a number of times. The steps are:

* `python step2_run_JAGS.py config_files/config_2_full.yaml 1 1 1 2 1` # (parameter estimation, no pooling)
* `python step2_run_JAGS.py config_files/config_2_full.yaml 1 1 2 2 2` # (parameter estimation, partial pooling)
* `python step2_run_JAGS.py config_files/config_2_full.yaml 1 1 3 2 3` # (parameter estimation, full pooling)
* `python step2_run_JAGS.py config_files/config_2_full.yaml 2 1 1 2 4` # (model comparison - data pooling)
* `python step2_run_JAGS.py config_files/config_2_full.yaml 3 1 1 2 5` # (model comparison - EE vs EUT)
* `python step2_run_JAGS.py config_files/config_2_full.yaml 3 2 1 2 6` # (model comparison - weak EE vs EUT)

The arguments in order:
1. the config file to be used
2. Sets the `inferenceMode`, it can be `1`, `2` or `3` and decides if to perform model inversion for parameter estimation or model selection. In mode `2` it is doing model selection between pooling methods.
3. Sets the `model_selection_type`, it can be `1` for EE vs EUT or `2`, for weakEE vs EUT, ignored in other modes.
4. This sets the data pooling: 1 - no pooling, 2 partial pooling, 3 full pooling and is ignored in other modes.
4. This sets the submission method. It can be `1` for simply sourcing the shell script or `2` for commiting the script via SLURM.
5. Which JAGS, set this to run multiple JAGS models at the same time.

The `step_2_runJ_JAGS.py` script creates a shell script in `sh_scripts` which will then be run by the program. The following `configs[data_type]`, `configs[data variant]` and `configs[qual]` are important.

Note further, that not all arguments from the config files are used! For a new data set make sure that you have the correct name pairing and parameters in `set_Bayesian.m` lines 30 ff.

```{matlab}
switch dataSource
    case {0}
        switch simVersion
            case {1}, subjList = 1:(1*10); nTrials = 160; folder = '0_simulation/grid/eta_n05';
            case {2}, subjList = 1:(1*10); nTrials = 160; folder = '0_simulation/grid/eta_00';
            case {3}, subjList = 1:(1*10); nTrials = 160; folder = '0_simulation/grid/eta_05';
            case {4}, subjList = 1:(1*10); nTrials = 160; folder = '0_simulation/grid/eta_10';
            case {5}, subjList = 1:(1*10); nTrials = 160; folder = '0_simulation/grid/eta_15';
            case {6}, subjList = 1:(1*10); nTrials = 160; folder = '0_simulation/grid/time_optimal';
            case {7}, subjList = 1:(2*10); nTrials = 160; folder = '0_simulation/varying_variance';
            case {8}, subjList = 1:(2*10); nTrials = 160; folder = '0_simulation/strong_weak_signal';
        end %simVersion
    case {1}, subjList = 1:11; nTrials = 160; folder = '1_pilot'; %Pilot data
    case {2}, subjList = 1:57; nTrials = 160; folder = '2_full_data';%Full experiment data
end %dataSource
```

## Step3: Create figures and run further analysis:

Again this requires the configs file and creates most of the other figures that are displayed in the paper (and more) and performs further analyses.

`python step3_main_analysis.py config_files/1_pilot.yaml`

There are a few substeps:
**Bracketing method**

This stage of the pipeline uses the 'all_data.csv' file and estimate the parameters using the bracketing method. It outputs two files 'bracketing_overview' and 'logistic' in both '.csv' and '.pkl' format.

**Create JASP input**

We are not using JASP anymore, but it is here for posterity and we call an
Rscript on the outputs.
This step uses the 'JAGS_parameter_estimation_{pooling}.mat' and the 'bracketing_overview.csv' files and creates a new file called 'jasp_input.csv'.

**Creating Plots**

The final step of the pipeline creates plots based on the dataframes created in the previous stages. The plots are saved in the 'figs' subfolder. Due to data sharing limitations, you won't be able to run the no brainer analysis, which is de-activated by default.

## Step4: Create grid figure

If you have run the simulations using JAGS for configs 1 - 6, you can now create the simulation grid figure, it uses data stored under `data/0_simulation/grid`:

`python step4_plot_grid.py config_files/config_0_simulations_1.yaml`

## Step5: Model comparison

This step runs the model comparison. You will have to set the path to the (VBA_toolbox)[https://github.com/MBB-team/VBA-toolbox] in `step5_model_comparison` by changing the `vba_path` variable in the config files.

This step has three modes, one for each model comparison approach:

`python step5_model_comparison.py config_files/config_1_pilot.yaml 1`
`python step5_model_comparison.py config_files/config_1_pilot.yaml 2`
`python step5_model_comparison.py config_files/config_1_pilot.yaml 3`

## Step6: Renaming figures

This step is mostly for convenience, it moves and renames the figures that are shown in the manuscript.

`python step6_plots_to_paper.py`

## Bayesian Regression Analysis

To run the Bayesian regression analysis the script `additional_analysis.py` need to be run to create the data frames
for the subsequent analysis in R (`regression_Analysis.R`), which uses the BAS package.

For privacy reasons, we are not sharing the demographic and questionnaire data, at this point.

# Setting up JAGS

JAGS is used to run the Bayesian analyses see https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/. We call JAGS from the MatJags library, which allows us to run JAGS models from within Matlab.

## Installing MatJags

To install MatJags, please follow the detailed installation instructions found in the MatJags repository (https://github.com/msteyvers/matjags).
