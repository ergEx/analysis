% setHLM sets up multiple HLM models to run sequentially according to inputs

% This function takes the following inputs:

% DataSource  - set which data source is used; Simualtion (0)
%                                              Pilot (1)
%                                              Full experiment (2)
% SimVersion - set which simulation to run (only used if DataSource is simulation);
%                                              grid with varying values (1-6)
%                                              varying noise (7)
%                                              varying ground truth risk aversion, and varying noise (8)
% dataPooling - set whether to do No pooling (1)
%                                 Partial pooling (individual estimates from group level distributions) (2)
%                                 Full pooling (super individual) (3)
% inferenceMode - set whether to do parameter estimation (1) or Bayesian model comparison (2)
% whichJAGS     - which copy of matjags to run on. this allows parallel jobs to run as long as they use different matjags
% whichQuals    - sets the order of qualities to run
% doParallel    - whether to run chains in parallel

%% Specifies qualities to be selected from
numRuns      = length(dataPooling);     %how many separate instances of an MCMC to run

nChains      = [4,4,4,4,4];            %Keep this to 4
nThin        = 10;                     %thinnning factor, 1 = no thinning, 2=every 2nd etc.

%% Specifies subjects, trials and directory_name
